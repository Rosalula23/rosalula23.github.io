        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this report is to evaluate digital accessibility for the Akiruno City Library. 
                This is to minimize the potential for access issues arising from the use of assistive technologies. 
            </p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Title &#128077;</dt>
                    <dd>&#9733;Component: text values within the < title > tag. </dd>
                    <dd>&#9733;Results: Pages within the site each have clear, concise titles.
                        However, there are a large number of pages within the site, 
                        and titles of subpages do not note that they are still on the Akiruno City Library page. 
                        For users without visual impairments, this is made clear by a header logo image.</dd>
                <dt>Image Text Alternatives &#128078;</dt>
                        <dd>&#9733;Component: text which conveys the content of images via text.</dd>
                        <dd>&#9733;Results:
                            <ul>&#9733;The logos used have descriptive alt text, as to buttons to linked services which feature images. 
                                The slideshow featured on the main page of the site does not have alt text. WAVE identified 4 items with 
                                empty alternative text, alongside 5 images with appropriate alt text. </ul>
                            <ul>&#9733;The site as a whole does not heavily rely on images, and primarily contains text. 
                                There are few alt text errors in the bulk of the website because there are very few images 
                                present outside of the main page.</ul>
                        </dd>
                <dt>Text &#128077;</dt>
                    <dd>&#9733;Component:The content of the pages. </dd>
                    <dd>&#9733;Results:
                             <ul>&#9733;Heading:Heading: the main page only has one < h1 >, but other pages
                                     on the site have multiple headings on the same level, which may be confusing to screen readers.</ul>
                            <ul>&#9733;Contrast: WAVE reported only 2 contrast errors on the main page, both in the controls for the slideshow. 
                                    They are white on a blue background and very small, which may be difficult to read. 
                                    There are very few errors outside the main page, however. </ul>
                            <ul>&#9733;Resizing Text: the page itself offers a function to resize text between 
                                    small, medium, and large. Page adjusts well to zoom functions through the browser.</ul>
                    </dd>
                <dt>Interaction &#128077;</dt>
                        <dd>&#9733;Component: use of the keyboard only to navigate the web page.</dd>
                        <dd>&#9733;Results: keyboard only navigation is possible.
                             Navigation using arrows and the tab key followed a sequential order from the top of the page to the bottom.
                              Links could be opened through the enter key. Returning to a previous page after following these links was difficult,
                               though the presence of a “return to home” link on each page made it simpler to navigate. 
                            Forms were easily accessible and usable with only a keyboard.</dd>
                <dt>General &#128077;</dt>
                        <dd>&#9733;Component: other content present on the page, as well as basic structure</dd>
                        <dd>&#9733;Results:
                            <ul>&#9733;Moving, flashing, or blinking content:There is not flashing or blinking content.
                                 There is a moving slideshow on the main page which can be paused.
                                 However, the slideshow is missing alt text and the controls for the slideshow have poor contrast. </ul>
                            <ul>&#9733;Multimedia: The slideshow is the only media present, so there are no issues with closed captioning or transcripts. </ul>
                            <ul>&#9733;Basic Structure: Thanks to the lack of images and high organizations, the basic structure of the page is 
                                maintained even without styling and images. 
                                WAVE removed the styles and images and very little about the page changed. 
                                This suggests there will be good translation to a screen reader. </ul>
                        </dd>
            </dl>
        <h3>Summary &#128077;</h3>
            <p>Though there are some images with missing alt text, and some pages with a potentially confusing header structure,
                 the majority of this website had few accessibility issues. The lack of images and heavy reliance on texts improves 
                 the ability to access the site via screen reader or through only keyboard navigation. The presence of font sizing tools 
                 further improves readability for those with visual impairments. Though the blue and white color scheme could be difficult
                  for those with color blindness to see, contrast errors are offset by the use of bold text, and by minimal use of these 
                  colors for text content. Overall, this webpage has good accessibility.</p>
